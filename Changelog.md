# Changelog for `wile`

## Current version `wile` (0 9 1)

- rework internal buffers to no longer use scratch files

- still working on adding doc-strings to more and more functions

- more work on making RTL stack-friendly

- work toward making closures fully first-class; still a ways to go

- start working on eval - a simple REPL is already possible, although
  still very limited: proof of concept only so far

## Current version `wile` (0 9 0) 2023-10-11

- implement `((val val val...) => proc-ish)` syntax for `case`

- implement more robust detection of mismatch in configuration between
  library and main program during compilation: put a do-nothing stub
  routine encoding the configuration into the library, and call that
  routine from main. each routine's name is generated by C macros,
  so they will differ for different configurations -> link fails

- make `floor` `ceiling` `round` handle all real-valued numbers

- bump `global-tc-min-args` up to 8... that removes a lot of warnings
  when the compiler rebuilds itself

- add an examples subdirectory with a couple of tiny separate programs
  that actually do non-compiler-related stuff

- rework code to build the RTL; now optimized and debug versions are
  equally easy to build

- fix bugs in `memv` `assv`

- change order of bits in output of `(wile-build-info)`

- make `char->string` work on list of characters as well as a literal
  list of character arguments, ie `(char->string '(#\a #\b #\c))` and
  `(char->string #\a #\b #\c)` will both generate the same "abc" output

- **MAKE WILE SELF-HOSTING** w00t!
