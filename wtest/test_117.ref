now is the time
for all good men and true
to come to the aid of their party
NOW IS THE TIME
FOR ALL GOOD MEN AND TRUE
TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR PARTY
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.
