Ugh. I just realized that all of these are full of macros. I can
compile them with my interpreted version of wile, but that relies on
my environment which I'm trying to escape. The compiled version of
wile is not yet clever enough to do much of anything here. Please
consider this a preview of coming attractions, mea culpa!
